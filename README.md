kfigr
=====

kfigr is a streamlined cross-referencing system for R markdown documents that 
integrates with the [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr) package. It defines 
a hook for anchoring code chunks and tracks chunks for cross-referencing document 
elements like figures, tables and code blocks.
