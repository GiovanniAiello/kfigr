[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mkoohafkan/kfigr.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mkoohafkan/kfigr)

kfigr is a streamlined cross-referencing system for R markdown documents that 
integrates with the [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr) package. It defines 
a hook for anchoring code chunks and tracks chunks for cross-referencing 
document elements like figures, tables and code blocks.

Update 2015-07-14
-----------------

Version 1.2 submitted to CRAN! This version makes package attaching and 
detaching a bit cleaner. I have also converted all documentation from 
`inlinedocs` to `Roxygen2`. Package functionality remains unchanged.
